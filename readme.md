Climate Data by Country
This web app allows users to select a country from either an interactive map, or a drop-down menu when in mobile mode.

Based upon their selection, the page will output a table of metrics for that state from the years 2007 to 2014, showing both total carbon emissions of that country, side by side with the country's population from that year.

The page will also generate a visual representation via D3 Bar Chart (or equipvalent), to better illustrate the changing trends in populations and carbon emissions, and highlight any interesting trends.

Mission
A place where people can search, view emission data, connect with others and what they can do to combat emission using beautiful graphics and quality data in one place.

MVP
Scope from US to World. Date range from 2017 on wards?
Add wedge chart that shows non-renewable energy consumption (past and predictive) and renewable consumption. Each wedge should have break down of energy type. 
One interactive wedge (Reduction) will allow visualization of individual/community effort to combat emission. 
For each country, there will be a discussion forum that allows users to interact on whatever enviral content they'd like (Q: sign in users? etc.)
Maybe add link to different orgs to donate funds

Tech stack: 
Node/Express: qq 
Sql database/CRUD: Dicussion forum and Reductions
APIs/NPM package for Maps
For APIs, make sure to use environment variable to conceal API keys


Differentiation notes: 
Add Paris reduction targets to either our own API/Sql as it is not being aggregated by any agency.
Visualization makes data more digestable
